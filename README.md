# Facio Employee Recognition Attendance System

<p> In this project, I have developed a web application, in which the attendance of employees is carried out using real-time face recognition, and the attendance is marked inside the application and also on a csv file, which can be easily saved locally. This is an ongoing project, and its scope will be brodened by integrating it into a cctv camera. </p>


<p> This application is made using Django web framework of Python. </p>

<p> If you want to make a similar system for your organziation, please keep in touch. </p>
